## 🔍 Research Focus: Understanding the Inner Workings of LLMs

I am a Research Assistant at the University of Tübingen, working with [Dr. Thomas Wolfers](https://thomaswolfers.com/) and [Dr. Çağatay Yıldız](https://cagatayyildiz.github.io/) on the mechanistic interpretability of large language models. My research centers on developing novel approaches to understand how these complex systems acquire, represent, and access knowledge.

## 🧪 Current Research

My work focuses on two complementary areas:

**Knowledge Measurement & Evaluation**: Developing contamination-free evaluation frameworks for domain-specific knowledge in LLMs, extending beyond traditional perplexity metrics to understand true domain understanding.

**Activation Engineering**: Investigating how domain knowledge emerges as targetable directions in model activation space, enabling systematic control without traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## 💡 Research Philosophy

Following Richard Feynman's principle "What I cannot create, I do not understand," my research aims to reverse-engineer the internal mechanisms of language models. By understanding how these systems process and represent knowledge, we can build more reliable, controllable, and interpretable AI systems.

## 🔬 Key Contributions

- **Domain-Specific Evaluation**: Created deterministic pipelines for contamination-free LLM evaluation using large-scale datasets (arXiv: 1.56M documents, M2D2: 8.5B tokens)
- **Continual Learning**: Investigated how model size affects knowledge acquisition and retention during continual pretraining across diverse domains
- **Activation Engineering**: Developed techniques to access latent knowledge through steering vectors and activation patterns

## 🎯 Impact & Applications

This research enables practical breakthroughs in:
- **Model Efficiency**: Targeted knowledge editing without full retraining
- **Safety & Control**: Direct model steering through activation engineering  
- **Robust Evaluation**: Better understanding of what models truly know vs. memorize
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Optimizing how models adapt to new domains
