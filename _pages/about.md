## 🔍 Research Focus: Understanding the Inner Workings of LLMs

I am a Research Assistant at the University of Tübingen, working with [Dr. Thomas Wolfers](https://thomaswolfers.com/) and [Dr. Çağatay Yıldız](https://cagatayyildiz.github.io/) on the mechanistic interpretability of large language models. My research centers on developing novel approaches to understand how these complex systems acquire, represent, and access knowledge.

## 🧪 Current Research

My work focuses on two complementary areas:

**Steering Vectors for Knowledge Access**: Developing activation engineering techniques using tuned lens, logit lens, causal tracing, and activation patching to localize domain-specific knowledge representations across model layers. Analyzing attribute extraction rates and layer-wise knowledge evolution through hook-based interventions to identify targetable directions for systematic model control.

**Domain-Specific LLM Evaluation**: Created a deterministic pipeline for contamination-free benchmark generation from raw corpora, tested on large-scale datasets (arXiv: 1.56M documents, M2D2: 8.5B tokens). Currently extending this framework to medical and mental health domains with focus on safety-critical evaluation and data contamination effects.

## 💡 Research Philosophy

Following Richard Feynman's principle "What I cannot create, I do not understand," my research aims to reverse-engineer the internal mechanisms of language models. By understanding how these systems process and represent knowledge, we can build more reliable, controllable, and interpretable AI systems.

## 🔬 Key Contributions

- **Domain-Specific Evaluation**: Created deterministic pipelines for contamination-free LLM evaluation using large-scale datasets (arXiv: 1.56M documents, M2D2: 8.5B tokens)
- **Continual Learning**: Investigated how model size affects knowledge acquisition and retention during continual pretraining across diverse domains (TMLR, 55+ citations)
- **Activation Engineering**: Developing techniques to access latent knowledge through steering vectors, causal interventions, and activation pattern analysis
- **Layer-wise Knowledge Representation**: Revealed that initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction while later layers focus on next token prediction, with implications for targeted fine-tuning and catastrophic forgetting mitigation

## 🎯 Impact & Applications

This research enables practical breakthroughs in:
- **Model Efficiency**: Targeted knowledge editing without full retraining; early stopping strategies during model training
- **Safety & Control**: Direct model steering through activation engineering  
- **Robust Evaluation**: Better understanding of what models truly know vs. memorize
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Optimizing how models adapt to new domains while preserving critical knowledge

## 🤝 Opportunities & Collaboration

I am actively seeking collaborations and am open to supervising research projects in mechanistic interpretability. 

**Research Collaboration**: If you're working on related topics in mechanistic interpretability, circuit discovery, activation engineering, or knowledge representation in LLMs, I'd be delighted to discuss potential synergies and collaborative opportunities.

**Student Supervision**: I welcome Bachelor's and Master's students for theses, rotations, and internships on topics including:
- Knowledge localization and steering vectors in language models
- Circuit discovery and causal interventions
- Domain adaptation and continual learning mechanisms
- Activation engineering for model control
- Safety-critical evaluation in specialized domains
