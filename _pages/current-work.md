# Current Research Projects

## Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis
I'm currently working on developing advanced deep learning models for medical image segmentation and classification. This project focuses on improving the accuracy of disease detection in X-ray and MRI images using novel neural network architectures.

### Key Achievements:
- Developed a new convolutional neural network architecture that improved accuracy by 15%
- Successfully implemented attention mechanisms for better feature extraction
- Currently working on making the model more interpretable for clinical use

## Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
Another significant project involves analyzing clinical notes using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. We're working on:
- Automated extraction of medical conditions from physician notes
- Prediction of patient outcomes based on historical data
- Development of more efficient clinical documentation systems
