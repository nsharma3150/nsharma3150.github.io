Based on the provided materials, I'll help craft an engaging "About Me" section that maintains professionalism while being personable. Here's a suggested version:

# About Me

üîç **Research Journey**

My journey into understanding complex systems began at IIT Roorkee, where I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering Physics, graduating with the Department Gold Medal (9.57/10) and Best Thesis Award in 2023. What started as curiosity about signal processing in Dr. R.S. Anand's lab, working on EEG-based epilepsy detection, evolved into a deeper fascination with neural systems and their computational understanding.

This pursuit led me to a DAAD WISE scholarship at Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, where I worked on MRI-based biomarkers for Major Depressive Disorder. The experience sparked my interest in bridging neuroscience with machine learning, ultimately leading to publications in Biological Psychiatry and successful pre-prints on ketamine's effects on brain connectivity.

Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Neural Information Processing at the University of T√ºbingen (1.24/4.0), supported by the Deutschlandstipendium scholarship. As a research assistant at the [Mental Health Mapping Lab](https://mhm-lab.github.io/) under [Dr. Thomas Wolfers](https://thomaswolfers.github.io/), I've been exploring the intersection of healthcare and AI, developing interpretable models for clinical applications. I'm particularly proud of our work on postoperative delirium prediction, where we emphasized model interpretability through SHAP values to ensure clinical relevance.

üß™ **Current Focus**

My current research at the Bethge Lab, under [Prof. Matthias Bethge](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/institut-fuer-theoretische-physik/arbeitsgruppen/ag-bethge/) and [Dr. Cagatay Yildiz](https://cagatayyildiz.github.io/) at the [Bethge Lab](https://bethgelab.org/), investigates how language models acquire and represent knowledge during training. This work combines my interests in theoretical understanding and practical applications. I'm also developing a GAMLSS-based Python package for neuroimaging applications, already in use by lab members.


üß™ **Current Focus**

My fascination with understanding the inner workings of AI systems led me to focus on mechanistic interpretability for my master's thesis at the [Bethge Lab](https://bethgelab.org/), under [Prof. Matthias Bethge](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/institut-fuer-theoretische-physik/arbeitsgruppen/ag-bethge/) and [Dr. Cagatay Yildiz](https://cagatayyildiz.github.io/). Here, I'm investigating how language models acquire and represent knowledge during continual pre-training across different domains, working with the vast arXiv dataset (over 1.5 million documents) to develop frameworks that can predict optimal pre-training domains for specific tasks based on patterns in the model's internal representations.

Parallel to my thesis work, I'm developing a GAMLSS-based Python package for neuroimaging applications at the [Mental Health Mapping Lab](https://mhm-lab.github.io/) under [Dr. Thomas Wolfers](https://thomaswolfers.github.io/). This package, which implements Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape, is already being utilized by lab members for their research and will be publicly released in early months of 2025.

From January to March 2024, I'll be continuing my exploration of AI interpretability as a HiWi under Dr. √áaƒüatay Yƒ±ldiz in Claire Vernade's lab, further deepening my understanding of how we can make AI systems more transparent and reliable.

üë®‚Äçüè´ **Teaching & Mentoring**

I believe in giving back to the academic community. As a Teaching Assistant for the Neuromatch Academy's Deep Learning Course (2024), I've had the privilege of guiding international students through complex concepts. My experience includes mentoring first-year students at IIT Roorkee and leading programming tutorials in the Academic Reinforcement Program.

üå± **Beyond Research**

When I'm not delving into neural networks, you'll find me on the beach volleyball court or training for long-distance runs - I've participated in 100km marathons at university! I'm also passionate about community service, having led initiatives like 'Daan Petika' during my time as an Executive at NSS IIT Roorkee, organizing blood donation camps and environmental cleanup drives.

Currently, I'm seeking PhD positions and research opportunities while working on manuscripts from my thesis and normative modeling work. I'm excited about contributing to the future of interpretable AI systems that can reliably serve human needs.
