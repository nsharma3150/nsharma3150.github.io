    <h2><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.10.24318590v1">Predicting Mental and Neurological Illnesses Based on Cerebellar Normative Features</a></h2>
    <p>Milin Kim, <strong>Nitin Sharma</strong>, Esten H Leonardsen, Saige Rutherford, Geir Selbæk, Karin Persson, et al.</p>
    <p>medRxiv, 2024</p>
    <p>This study used machine learning to test whether individual differences in cerebellar brain structure could help predict various mental and neurological conditions. The research analyzed brain imaging data from over 27,000 participants and found that cerebellar features could moderately predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ), with accuracy rates between 56-64%. The strongest predictive signals came from the posterior regions of the cerebellum - areas more strongly linked to higher cognitive functions than motor control.</p>

    <p>Shun-Chin Jim Wu*, <strong>Nitin Sharma*</strong>, Anne Bauch, Hao-Chun Yang, Jasmine L Hect, et al.</p>
    <p>medRxiv, 2024</p>
    <p>This study analyzed data from 1,624 elderly patients (≥70 years) across five medical centers to develop machine learning models for predicting postoperative delirium (POD). Using demographic, clinical, surgical, and neuropsychological features, the models achieved strong predictive performance (AUC 0.79) before surgery, with specific cognitive tests like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment memory subdomain and Trail Making Test Part B emerging as crucial predictors. The findings demonstrate that effective POD risk prediction is possible before surgery, potentially enabling better surgical planning and postoperative care for high-risk patients.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr826128">Ketamine-induced pleasant but not unpleasant dissociation is linked to the functional connectivity profile of the posteromedial cortex</a></h2>
    <p>Zumrut Duygu Sen, <strong>Nitin Sharma</strong>, Lena Vera Danyeli, Lejla Colic, et al.</p>
    <p>PsyArXiv, 2024</p>
    <p>This study reveals that pleasant dissociative experiences during ketamine treatment can be predicted by examining the functional connections of the posteromedial cortex (PMC) in the brain, both before and during ketamine infusion. The research found that pleasant dissociation correlates with specific brain connectivity patterns, particularly between the PMC and control network regions, while unpleasant dissociation shows no such correlation - suggesting different neural mechanisms underlie these two types of ketamine-induced experiences.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(23)00313-X/abstract">Ketamine-induced ego dissolution is related to the functional connectivity reconfiguration of the posteromedial cortex</a></h2>
    <p>Meng Li, <strong>Nitin Sharma</strong>, Lena Danyeli, Lejla Colic, et al.</p>
    <p>Biological Psychiatry, 2023</p>
    <p>A single dose of intravenous ketamine improves the severity of symptoms in disorders such as depression while also introducing acute and transient ego dissolution during administration. Understanding the neural correlates of ego dissolution may help elucidate its therapeutic effect mechanism. Previous studies suggested that the posteromedial cortex (PMC) activity is related to the altered sense of self and the sense of dissociation, phenomena underlying ego dissolution.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9566028">Epileptic seizure detection using STFT based peak mean feature and support vector machine</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Nitin Sharma</strong>, G Gaurav, RS Anand</p>
    <p>2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)</p>
    <p>This research presents a novel approach for detecting epileptic seizures using EEG data through a combination of Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and a new feature called "peak mean". The study decomposed EEG signals into sub-bands and extracted three key features - mean, sample entropy, and peak mean - achieving 100% classification accuracy in distinguishing epileptic ictal EEG signals from healthy subjects using Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (SVM-RBF). The proposed peak mean feature outperformed other commonly used features in epilepsy detection, demonstrating its potential for practical seizure detection applications.</p>
